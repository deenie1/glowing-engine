## [4.0.1-alpha.1]

### Added

-   `web3-rpc-methods` dependency (#5441)
-   Added chain and hardfork validation for transaction and transaction.common object in `validateTransactionForSigning`

### Changed

-   `Web3EthExecutionAPI` is now imported via `web3-types` instead of `web3_eth_execution_api.ts` (#5441)
-   Replace the imported methods from `rpc_methods.ts` with `ethRpcMethods` imports from `web3-rpc-methods` (#5441)

-   Implemented the logic for `transactionBlockTimeout` (#5294)
-   Use subscription at `rejectIfBlockTimeout` when the provider supports subscription. Implement this as an experimental feature (if `useSubscriptionWhenCheckingBlockTimeout` at `enableExperimentalFeatures` is `true`). (#5481)
-   At some test cases, optimized some codes. (#5481)

### Removed

-   Moved the errors' classes from `web3-eth/src/errors.ts` to `web3-errors/src/errors/transaction_errors.ts` (#5462)

-   [setimmediate](https://github.com/yuzujs/setImmediate) package to polyfill [setImmediate](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#setimmediatecallback-args) for browsers (#5450)

## [4.0.1-rc.0]

### Changed

-   Update imports statements for objects that was moved between web3 packages (#5771)
-   `sendTransaction` and `sendSignedTransaction` now errors with (and `error` event emits) the following possible errors: `TransactionRevertedWithoutReasonError`, `TransactionRevertInstructionError`, `TransactionRevertWithCustomError`, `InvalidResponseError`, or `ContractExecutionError` (#5854)

### Added

-   Added source files (#5956)

### Changed

-   `signTransaction` will now return `gas` instead of `gasLimit` for returned transaction object regardless of what property name the provider uses (#5915)

## [4.0.1-rc.2]

### Fixed

-   Fixed `ignoreGasPricing` bug with wallet in context (#6071)

### Changed

-   `formatTransaction` no longer throws a `TransactionDataAndInputError` if it's passed a transaction object with both `data` and `input` properties set (as long as they are the same value) (#6064)
-   Refactored documentation for `rpc_method_wrappers` to point to the previously duplicated documentation found under the `Web3Eth` class documentation (#6054)
-   Replaced Buffer for Uint8Array (#6004)
-   Refactored `defaultTransactionTypeParser` to return correct EIP-2718 types, prior implementation was prioritizing `transaction.hardfork` and ignoring the use of `transaction.gasLimit`. `defaultTransactionTypeParser` will now throw `InvalidPropertiesForTransactionTypeError`s for properties are used that are incompatible with `transaction.type` (#6102)

## [4.0.2]

### Changed

-   Dependencies updated

## [4.0.3]

### Changed

-   Dependencies updated

## [4.1.0]

### Fixed

-   sendTransaction will have gas filled by default using method `estimateGas` unless transaction builder `options.fillGas` is false. (#6249)
-   Missing `blockHeaderSchema` properties causing some properties to not appear in response of `newHeads` subscription (#6243)
-   Missing `blockHeaderSchema` properties causing some properties to not appear in response of `newHeads` subscription (#6243)

### Changed

-   `MissingGasError` error message changed for clarity (#6215)
-   `input` and `data` are no longer auto populated for transaction objects if they are not present. Instead, whichever property is provided by the user is formatted and sent to the RPC provider. Transaction objects returned from RPC responses are still formatted to contain both `input` and `data` properties (#6294)

### Added

-   A `rpc_method_wrapper` (`signTypedData`) for the rpc calls `eth_signTypedData` and `eth_signTypedData_v4` (#6286)

## [4.2.0]

### Added

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

-   Transactions will now default to type 2 transactions instead of type 0, similar to 1.x version. (#6282)

### Fixed

-   Ensure provider.supportsSubscriptions exists before watching by subscription (#6440)

### Added

-   Added `ALL_EVENTS` and `ALL_EVENTS_ABI` constants, `SendTransactionEventsBase` type, `decodeEventABI` method (#6410)

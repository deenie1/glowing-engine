# Sign and Send Transaction

You can sign and send transactions in different ways.

-   [Local wallet signing](/docs/guides/sign_and_send_tx/local_wallet)
-   [Using raw transaction](/docs/guides/sign_and_send_tx/raw)
-   [Using wallet of Eth Node](/docs/guides/sign_and_send_tx/wallet_of_eth_node)

For each of them you can use [Web3PromiEvent](/docs/guides/sign_and_send_tx/promi_event) to catch extra transaction's events

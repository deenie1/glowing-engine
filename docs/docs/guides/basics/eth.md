# Getting Started with `eth` Package

## Introduction

The `web3-eth` package provides a set of powerful functionalities to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the basics of using the `web3-eth` package of web3.js version 4. We will be using TypeScript throughout the examples.

## Overview

Here is a high-level overview of the steps we will be taking in this tutorial:

1. Setting up the Environment
2. Create a new project directory and initialize a new Node.js project.
3. Set up web3.js and connect to the Ganache network
4. Interact with the Ethereum blockchain using web3.js.
5. Importing specific package
6. Send different type of transactions
7. Package methods

## Step 1: Setting up the Environment

Before we start writing and deploying our contract, we need to set up our environment. For that, we need to install the following:

1. Ganache - Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development that allows you to see how your smart contracts function in real-world scenarios. You can download it from http://truffleframework.com/ganache
2. Node.js - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. npm - Node Package Manager is used to publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or a private npm registry. Here is how to install it https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm. (Alternatively, you can use yarn instead of npm https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/getting-started/)

## Step 2: Create a new project directory and initialize a new Node.js project

First, create a new project directory for your project and navigate into it:

```
mkdir web3-eth-tutorial
cd web3-eth-tutorial
```

Next, initialize a new Node.js project using npm:

```
npm init -y
```

This will create a new `package.json` file in your project directory.

```
npm i typescript @types/node
```

This will install typescript for our project and install the types for node.

## Step 3: Set up web3.js and connect to the Ganache network

In this step, we will set up the web3.js library and connect to the Ganache network. So, be sure to run Ganache if you did not already did.

First, install the `web3` package using npm:

```
npm i web3
```

Next, create a new file called `index.ts` in your project directory and add the following code to it:

<Tabs groupId="prog-lang" queryString>

<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript"
attributes={{className: "javascript-tab"}}>

```javascript
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); //  web3.js has native ESM builds and (`import Web3 from 'web3'`)

// Set up a connection to the Ganache network
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:7545'));

// Log the current block number to the console
web3.eth
	.getBlockNumber()
	.then(result => {
		console.log('Current block number: ' + result);
	})
	.catch(error => {
		console.error(error);
	});
```

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript" default 
  	attributes={{className: "typescript-tab"}}>

```typescript
import { Web3 } from 'web3';

// Set up a connection to the Ganache network
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:7545'));

// Log the current block number to the console
web3.eth
	.getBlockNumber()
	.then(result => {
		console.log('Current block number: ' + result);
	})
	.catch(error => {
		console.error(error);
	});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This code sets up a connection to the Ganache network and logs the current block number to the console.

Run the following command to test the connection:

```
npx ts-node index.ts
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see the current block number logged to the console. However, if you got an error with the reason `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:7545` then double check that you are running Ganache locally on port `7545`.

## Step 4: Interact with the Ethereum blockchain using web3.js

In this step, we will use web3.js to interact with the Ganache network.

In the first example, we are going to send a simple value transaction.
Create a file named `transaction.ts` and fill it with the following code:

<Tabs groupId="prog-lang" queryString>

<TabItem value="javascript" label="JavaScript"
attributes={{className: "javascript-tab"}}>

```javascript
const { Web3 } = require('web3'); //  web3.js has native ESM builds and (`import Web3 from 'web3'`)
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// Set up a connection to the Ethereum network
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:7545'));
web3.eth.Contract.handleRevert = true;

async function interact() {
	//fetch all the available accounts
	const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
	console.log(accounts);

	let balance1, balance2;
	//The initial balances of the accounts should be 100 Eth (10^18 wei)
	balance1 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);
	balance2 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[1]);

	console.log(balance1, balance2);

	//create a transaction sending 1 Ether from account 0 to account 1
	const transaction = {
		from: accounts[0],
		to: accounts[1],
		// value should be passed in wei. For easier use and to avoid mistakes,
		//	we utilize the auxiliary `toWei` function:
		value: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether'),
	};

	//send the actual transaction
	const transactionHash = await web3.eth.sendTransaction(transaction);
	console.log('transactionHash', transactionHash);

	balance1 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);
	balance2 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[1]);

	// see the updated balances
	console.log(balance1, balance2);

	// irrelevant with the actual transaction, just to know the gasPrice
	const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
	console.log(gasPrice);
}

(async () => {
	await interact();
})();
```

  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript" default 
  	attributes={{className: "typescript-tab"}}>

```typescript
import { Web3 } from 'web3';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

// Set up a connection to the Ethereum network
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:7545'));
web3.eth.Contract.handleRevert = true;

async function interact() {
	//fetch all the available accounts
	const accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
	console.log(accounts);

	let balance1, balance2;
	//The initial balances of the accounts should be 100 Eth (10^18 wei)
	balance1 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);
	balance2 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[1]);

	console.log(balance1, balance2);

	//create a transaction sending 1 Ether from account 0 to account 1
	const transaction = {
		from: accounts[0],
		to: accounts[1],
		// value should be passed in wei. For easier use and to avoid mistakes,
		//	we utilize the auxiliary `toWei` function:
		value: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether'),
	};

	//send the actual transaction
	const transactionHash = await web3.eth.sendTransaction(transaction);
	console.log('transactionHash', transactionHash);

	balance1 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);
	balance2 = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[1]);

	// see the updated balances
	console.log(balance1, balance2);

	// irrelevant with the actual transaction, just to know the gasPrice
	const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
	console.log(gasPrice);
}

(async () => {
	await interact();
})();
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
üìù When running a local development blockchain using Ganache, all accounts are typically unlocked by default, allowing easy access and transaction execution during development and testing. This means that the accounts are accessible without requiring a private key or passphrase. That's why we just indicate the accounts in the examples with the `from` field.
:::

Run the following:

```
npx ts-node transaction.ts
```

If everything is working correctly, you should see something like the following:

:::note
üìù In order to calculate the actual ether spent, we have to calculate the value sent plus the fees. Initial_balance = (Remaining_balance + value + gasUsed\*gasPrice). In our case:

98999580000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + (20000000000\*21000) = 100 Ether
:::

In the next example, we are going to use `estimateGas` function to see the expected gas for contract deployment. (For more on contracts, please see the corresponding tutotial). Create a file named `estimate.ts` and fill it with the following code:

}
```

## Step 5: Importing specific package

To harness the capabilities of the web3-eth package, you can opt to import this package directly rather than depending on the global web3 package, which will result in a reduction in the build size.

### Import web3-eth directly

For example [getBalance](/api/web3-eth/function/getBalance) method:

```typescript
import Web3Eth from 'web3-eth';

const eth = new Web3Eth('http://localhost:7545');

async function test() {
	const accounts = await eth.getAccounts();
	const currentBalance = await eth.getBalance(accounts[0]);
	console.log('Current balance:', currentBalance);
	// 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039437613106102441895127n
}

(async () => {
	await test();
})();
```

### Set config directly to web3-eth package

```typescript
import Web3Eth from 'web3-eth';

const eth = new Web3Eth('http://localhost:8545');

console.log('defaultTransactionType before', eth.config.defaultTransactionType);
// defaultTransactionType before 0x0

eth.setConfig({ defaultTransactionType: '0x1' });

console.log('eth.config.defaultTransactionType after', eth.config.defaultTransactionType);
// defaultTransactionType before 0x1
```

## Step 6: Send different type of transactions:

### Legacy Transaction

In Ethereum, a "legacy transaction" typically refers to the traditional transactions, where gas fees are set explicitly by the sender and can fluctuate based on network demand. These legacy transactions were prevalent on the Ethereum network before the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559.

Key characteristics of legacy transactions include:

1. Gas Price: In legacy transactions, the sender specifies a gas price (in Gwei) that they are willing to pay for each unit of gas consumed by the transaction. The gas price can be adjusted by the sender, and it determines the transaction's priority in getting processed by miners. Higher gas prices mean faster transaction confirmation.

2. Gas Limit: The sender also sets a gas limit, which is the maximum amount of gas that the transaction can consume. Gas is the computational fuel used to execute transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum network. The gas limit is primarily set to ensure that the sender doesn't run out of Ether while processing the transaction. It can also impact the success or failure of the transaction.

3. Uncertainty in Fees: Legacy transactions are subject to fluctuating gas prices based on network congestion. During periods of high demand, gas prices can surge, causing users to pay more for their transactions to be processed promptly. Conversely, during quieter network periods, users can pay lower fees.

4. Manual Fee Estimation: Users are responsible for manually estimating the appropriate gas price to include in their legacy transactions to ensure timely processing. This process can be challenging, as setting gas prices too low may result in slow confirmation, while setting them too high may lead to overpaying.

5. EIP-1559, as described below, introduced changes to Ethereum's transaction fee system, making it more user-friendly and predictable. With EIP-1559, the concept of a "base fee" replaces the manual setting of gas prices, which has reduced some of the uncertainties associated with legacy transactions.

While EIP-1559 has significantly improved the user experience, legacy transactions are still supported on the Ethereum network, and users can continue to send transactions with manually specified gas prices and gas limits if they prefer. However, the EIP-1559 mechanism is now the recommended approach for most transactions, as it simplifies the process and reduces the likelihood of overpaying for fees.

To send Legacy transaction use code below:

```typescript
import Web3 from 'web3';
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');

async function test() {
	const privateKey = 'YOUR PRIVATE KEY HERE';
	// add private key to wallet to have auto-signing transactions feature
	const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
	web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);

	// create transaction object
	const tx = {
		from: account.address,

		gasPrice: await web3.eth.getGasPrice(),
		type: BigInt(0), // <- specify type
	};

	// send transaction
	const receipt = await web3.eth.sendTransaction(tx);

	console.log('Receipt:', receipt);
	// Receipt: {
	//   blockHash: '0xc0f2fea359233b0843fb53255b8a7f42aa7b1aff53da7cbe78c45b5bac187ad4',

}
(async () => {

})();
```

### EIP-2930 Transaction

Ethereum Improvement Proposal 2930 is a proposal for a change to the Ethereum network that was implemented as part of the Berlin hard fork, which was activated in April 2021. EIP-2930 introduces a feature called "Transaction Type and Access List." This improvement enhances the gas efficiency of certain smart contract interactions and provides more flexibility in specifying who can access specific resources within a smart contract. Here are the key components of EIP-2930:

1. Transaction Type: EIP-2930 introduces a new transaction type called "Access List Transaction." This transaction type is designed to make certain interactions with smart contracts more efficient by allowing the sender to specify a list of addresses that may be accessed or modified during the transaction.

2. Access List: The Access List is a structured data format included with the transaction. It contains a list of addresses and storage keys that are expected to be accessed or modified during the execution of the transaction. This helps in reducing the amount of gas required for these operations, as miners can check the Access List to optimize the execution.

3. Gas Savings: EIP-2930 is intended to significantly reduce the gas costs for transactions that use the Access List feature. By specifying which storage slots and addresses are relevant to the transaction, it allows for a more efficient use of gas, especially in interactions with smart contracts that have a large state.

4. Contract Interactions: This improvement is particularly useful when interacting with contracts that have complex state structures, as it minimizes the gas required to read from or write to specific storage slots. This can lead to cost savings for users and make certain interactions more practical.

EIP-2930 is part of Ethereum's ongoing efforts to improve the network's efficiency and reduce transaction costs, making it more accessible and scalable for decentralized applications and users. It is especially beneficial for interactions with stateful contracts that rely on specific storage operations and access control mechanisms.

To send EIP-2930 transaction use code below:

```typescript
import Web3 from 'web3';
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');

async function test() {
	const privateKey = 'YOUR PRIVATE KEY HERE';
	// add private key to wallet to have auto-signing transactions feature
	const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
	web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);

	// create transaction object
	const tx = {
		from: account.address,
		to: '0x27aa427c1d668ddefd7bc93f8857e7599ffd16ab',
		value: '0x1',
		gasLimit: BigInt(21000),
		type: BigInt(1), // <- specify type
		// gasPrice - you can specify this property directly or web3js will fill this field automatically
	};

	// send transaction
	const receipt = await web3.eth.sendTransaction(tx);

	console.log('Receipt:', receipt);
	// Receipt: {
	//   blockHash: '0xd8f6a3638112d17b476fd1b7c4369d473bc1a484408b6f39dbf64410df44adf6',

	//   transactionIndex: 0n,
	//   type: 1n
	// }
}
(async () => {
	await test();
})();
```

Here is an example of how to use an access list in a transaction.

### EIP-1559 Transaction

Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559 is a significant upgrade to the Ethereum network's fee market and transaction pricing mechanism. It was implemented as part of the Ethereum London hard fork, which occurred in August 2021. EIP-1559 introduces several changes to how transaction fees work on the Ethereum blockchain, with the primary goals of improving user experience and network efficiency.

Here are some of the key features and changes introduced by EIP-1559:

1. Base Fee: EIP-1559 introduces a concept called the "base fee." The base fee is the minimum fee required for a transaction to be included in a block. It is determined algorithmically by the network and adjusts dynamically based on network congestion. When the network is busy, the base fee increases, and when it's less congested, the base fee decreases.

2. Inclusion Fee: In addition to the base fee, users can voluntarily include a "tip" or "inclusion fee" to incentivize miners to include their transactions in the next block. This allows users to expedite their transactions by offering a tip to miners.

3. Predictable Fees: With EIP-1559, users have a more predictable way to estimate transaction fees. They can set the maximum fee they are willing to pay, which includes the base fee and the tip. This eliminates the need for users to guess the appropriate gas price.

4. Burn Mechanism: EIP-1559 introduces a mechanism by which the base fee is "burned" from circulation, reducing the overall supply of Ether (ETH). This deflationary mechanism can help address some of the concerns related to the increasing supply of ETH and potentially make it a better store of value.

5. Improved Fee Auctions: Under EIP-1559, fee auctions are more efficient. Users specify the maximum fee they are willing to pay, and the protocol automatically adjusts the tip to ensure transactions get processed promptly without overpaying.

6. Simpler Transaction Process: Users experience a simplified transaction process, as they don't have to set gas prices manually. Instead, they specify the maximum fee they are willing to pay, and the wallet software handles the rest.

EIP-1559 has been well-received for its potential to create a more user-friendly and efficient transaction fee system, making the Ethereum network more accessible and predictable for users. It is also seen as an important step in the transition to Ethereum 2.0, which aims to address scalability and sustainability challenges on the network.

To send EIP-1559 transaction use code below:

```typescript
import Web3 from 'web3';
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545');

async function test() {
	const privateKey = 'YOUR PRIVATE KEY HERE';
	// add private key to wallet to have auto-signing transactions feature
	const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
	web3.eth.accounts.wallet.add(account);

	// create transaction object
	const tx = {
		from: account.address,
		to: '0x27aa427c1d668ddefd7bc93f8857e7599ffd16ab',
		value: '0x1',
		gasLimit: BigInt(21000),
		type: BigInt(2), // <- specify type
		// maxFeePerGas - you can specify this property directly or web3js will fill this field automatically
		// maxPriorityFeePerGas - you can specify this property directly or web3js will fill this field automatically
	};

	// send transaction
	const receipt = await web3.eth.sendTransaction(tx);

	console.log('Receipt:', receipt);
	// Receipt: {
	//   blockHash: '0xfe472084d1471720b6887071d32a793f7c4576a489098e7d2a89aef205c977fb',

	//   transactionIndex: 0n,
	//   type: 2n
	// }
}
(async () => {
	await test();
})();
```

## Step 7: Package methods

### createAccessList

Creating an access list in Ethereum is typically associated with Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-2930, which introduces a way to specify which accounts and storage keys a transaction expects to access. Access lists are used to optimize gas costs for transactions by providing explicit information about what the transaction needs to access.

The [createAccessList](/api/web3-eth/function/createAccessList) method is used to create an access list.

### estimateGas

The [estimateGas](/api/web3-eth/function/estimateGas) function is used to estimate the amount of gas that will be consumed when executing a specific transaction or invoking a contract function. This can be very useful when you want to determine the potential cost of a transaction or function call before actually sending it to the Ethereum network. It helps users ensure that they have enough ether to cover the gas costs for the operation.

### getBalance

The [getBalance](/api/web3-eth/function/getBalance) function is used to retrieve the balance of an Ethereum address, which represents the amount of Ether (ETH) associated with that address. It's a fundamental and frequently used function when working with Ethereum applications.

### getBlock

The [getBlock](/api/web3-eth/function/getBlock) function is used to retrieve information about a specific Ethereum block. Ethereum blocks are the fundamental building blocks of the blockchain, containing a collection of transactions and other data.

### getBlockNumber

The [getBlockNumber](/api/web3-eth/function/getBlockNumber) function is used to retrieve the latest block number (also known as the block height) of the Ethereum blockchain. The block number is a crucial piece of information in Ethereum as it represents the current state of the blockchain, indicating the total number of blocks that have been mined up to the present.

### getBlockTransactionCount

The [getBlockTransactionCount](/api/web3-eth/function/getBlockTransactionCount) function is used to retrieve the number of transactions in a specific Ethereum block. It allows you to determine how many transactions were included in a particular block on the Ethereum blockchain.

### getBlockUncleCount

The [getBlockUncleCount](/api/web3-eth/function/getBlockUncleCount) function is used to retrieve the number of uncle blocks associated with a specific Ethereum block. In Ethereum, uncle blocks (also known as "stale blocks" or "ommer blocks") are blocks that were mined but not included in the main blockchain. They are referenced by other blocks as a way to reward miners for their efforts even if their blocks weren't part of the main chain.

### getChainId

The [getChainId](/api/web3-eth/function/getChainId) function is used to retrieve the chain ID of the connected Ethereum network. The chain ID is a unique identifier for a specific Ethereum network, and it's used to help prevent replay attacks when signing transactions. Different Ethereum networks, such as the mainnet, testnets, and private networks, have distinct chain IDs.

### getCode

The [getCode](/api/web3-eth/function/getCode) function library is used to retrieve the bytecode of a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts on Ethereum are typically created by deploying bytecode to a specific address, and this function allows you to fetch the bytecode associated with a particular contract address.

### getCoinbase

The [getCoinbase](/api/web3-eth/function/getCoinbase) function is used to retrieve the address of the Ethereum account that is currently acting as the coinbase address for mining on the connected Ethereum node. The coinbase address is the address to which block rewards are sent when miners successfully mine a new block on the Ethereum blockchain. Miners configure their coinbase addresses to receive rewards for their mining efforts.

### getGasPrice

The [getGasPrice](/api/web3-eth/function/getGasPrice) function is used to retrieve the current gas price on the Ethereum network. Gas price is the amount of Ether (ETH) that users are willing to pay for each unit of gas when executing a transaction on the Ethereum network. Gas price is an important factor in determining the transaction fee (in ETH) for a transaction.

### getPendingTransactions

The [getPendingTransactions](/api/web3-eth/function/getPendingTransactions) function is used to retrieve information about pending transactions in the Ethereum network. Pending transactions are transactions that have been submitted to the network but have not yet been included in a mined block. This function allows you to access information about transactions that are waiting to be confirmed by miners.

### getProof

The [getProof](/api/web3-eth/function/getProof) function is used to obtain a Merkle proof or Patricia trie proof for a specific value or data in an Ethereum smart contract's storage. This function is typically used when you want to validate that a piece of data is stored in the contract's storage or to provide evidence for data inclusion without having to interact with the entire contract state.

In Ethereum, storage proofs are used to demonstrate the existence of a value within a contract's storage without querying the entire storage of the contract, which can be computationally expensive. These proofs are essential for various applications, including decentralized exchanges, blockchain explorers, and certain cryptographic operations.

### getProtocolVersion

You can use the [getProtocolVersion](/api/web3-eth/function/getProtocolVersion) method to retrieve the current Ethereum protocol version of the connected Ethereum node.

### getStorageAt

The [getStorageAt](/api/web3-eth/function/getStorageAt) method is used to fetch the data stored at a specific storage slot of an Ethereum address. It is often used for inspecting the internal state of smart contracts, especially when you want to retrieve the value of a specific variable in a contract's storage.

### getTransaction

The [getTransaction](/api/web3-eth/function/getTransaction) method allows you to retrieve information about a transaction based on its transaction hash. You provide the transaction hash, and this method returns an object containing details about the transaction

### getTransactionCount

The [getTransactionCount](/api/web3-eth/function/getTransactionCount) method allows you to retrieve the transaction count (nonce) of a specific Ethereum address.

### getTransactionReceipt

The [getTransactionReceipt](/api/web3-eth/function/getTransactionReceipt) method allows you to retrieve the transaction receipt for a specific transaction based on its transaction hash.

### getUncle

The [getUncle](/api/web3-eth/function/getUncle) method allows you to retrieve information about an uncle block at a specific index within a given block.

### isMining

The [isMining](/api/web3-eth/function/isMining) function returns a boolean value, indicating whether the node is actively mining or not.

### isSyncing

The [isSyncing](/api/web3-eth/function/isSyncing) method allows you to check the current synchronization status of your Ethereum node.

### sendTransaction

The [sendTransaction](/api/web3-eth/function/sendTransaction) method is used to create and send a transaction to the Ethereum network.

:::note
Please be cautious when sending transactions, especially when dealing with smart contracts, as they may execute specific functions that can have irreversible effects. Always ensure that the details in your transaction object are accurate and intended.

[Here](/guides/basics/sign_and_send_tx/) you can find more examples how to send transaction.

### sign

The [sign](/api/web3-eth/function/sign) method is used to sign a message or data using a private key. This is often used to prove ownership or authorship of a specific piece of data or to provide cryptographic proof in various Ethereum-related operations.

### signTransaction

The [signTransaction](/api/web3-eth/function/signTransaction) method is used to sign an Ethereum transaction, creating a signed transaction object that can be broadcast to the Ethereum network.

### sendSignedTransaction

The [sendSignedTransaction](/api/web3-eth/function/sendSignedTransaction) method is used to send a signed Ethereum transaction to the Ethereum network. Before sending a transaction, you need to sign it using a private key, and then you can use this method to broadcast the signed transaction to the network.
